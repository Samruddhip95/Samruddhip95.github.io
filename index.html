      <h1>Me</h1>
        <p class="lead">Believing in applying and transforming knowledge into
          innovation, I have developed several front-end web development
          projects. The closer I have got to technology, the broader is
          the amount of knowledge that I have gained regarding the pressing
          issues of cyber security and Information Technology. Hence, I have
          passionately followed various courses covering Web Development and
          analytics along with several ones on Information security in Society.
          My strengths include Front-end development, Information Technology
          and Security, Web analytics and data analysis. I have performed
          various group projects with students from different fields of
          engineering and cross-functionalities overall in my bachelor and have
          gained high level of interpersonal and communication skills. </p>

      <h1>Interests</h1>
      <p class="lead">I have undertaken a complete set of bachelor elective
        package on web technology, web development and analytics and hence feel
        that I have valuable knowledge to offer to the opportunity that will be
        provided to me. I have undertaken various insightful subjects like
        Human Technology Interaction, Design based learning and Engineering
        design. The reason for studying this package for my degree was that I
        feel the main goal of a front-end developer should be to help consumers
        make their time online enjoyable and pleasant which can be best done by
        understanding and realizing their interests, which is exactly what I
        have learnt from these subjects. </p>

    <h3>Information Secturity in Society</h3>
    <p> I gained a broad but detailed understanding about Information Security
      engineering. There are many concepts that become important in the future
      work environment which are considered highly important for growing
      companies. These include concepts like confidentiality, integrity,
      authenticity, availability, legal policies and digital flaws. As an
      engineer of the future, it becomes important to view these concepts from
      technical and societal perspectives. The rapid rise in technology demands
      engineers in work environments to know cryptography, digital security ,
      social psychology and law, and this is exactly what I learned from this
      package. </p>

    <h3>Web Technology</h3>
    <p> I have undertaken a complete set of bachelor elective package on web
      technology, web development and analytics and hence feel that I have
      valuable knowledge to offer to any opportunity that comes my way. I have
      undertaken various insightful subjects like Human Technology Interaction,
      Design based learning and Engineering design. The reason for studying
      this package for my degree was that I feel the main goal of a front-end

    <h3>Design for a Sustainable future</h3>
    <p> Deals with the limits that users, their culture and behavior put on the
      ability of sustainable development; concluding with the fact that "The
      limits on technology are caused by the birth of technology and the way we
      use it to sustain the environment and society around us. This goes as is
      said, the invention of something new will also be a risk and threat in
      itself."</p>

    <h3>ThermoStat Application</h3>
    <p>Designed, developed, tested, and evaluated a graphical (android-based)
      user-interface for a programmable week-thermostat having functionalities
      like defining a week program and controlling the heating system
      (wirelessly) and that users can save the program on the device and
      send/retrieve it to/from the heating system.</p>
      <p>I designed and coded the entire front-end and documenting the
      assignment report.</p>

  <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
      <h3>A/B Testing</h3>
      <p> Built a predictive model that would generalize well for future cases
        thinking what information would be available at time of casting a
         prediction. Further optimizing the predictive model generated by
         making it discrimination-aware and cost-sensitive and analysing the
         stability of PageRank as the graph evolves.</p>
        <p>I generated two models (unisex and per-gender) for
          discrimination-aware classification and finding subgroups
          where relevant discrimination can be found to generate a minimal
          discrimination model.I also analysed and reported the detected
          communities (using a script of community detection in python which
          implements the Louvain Algorithm) using different measures e.g.,
          visualization, edge density and modularity.</p>

    <h3>GELIFT</h3>
      <p>Developing a web and mobile application for a hitchhiking trip
        organized by GEWIS. The app will show real time location of all the
        teams participating in the hike competition. It will also track the time
        that the teams will take to reach destination and will have features
        like chats, possibility of uploading photos etc. between
        participants.</p>
        <p>I designed and implemented the front end of the web application
        required by adapting to
        SCRUM. Furthermore, I also designed mock-ups for the mobile and web
        applications. Documentations of the User requirements document, software
        requirement document and Architectural design document were also
        something I did with enthusiasm.</p>

      <h3>Web Pizzaiolos</h3>
      <p>Collaborated with 3 other team members for creation of a fully
        functional backend and front end website giving users to create,
        modify/share pizzas they created on our website and options to
        like/comment on their friends on our website</p>
        <p>In this project I designed the the front-end as well as the
          back-end with the group members and coded the complete front-end</p>
